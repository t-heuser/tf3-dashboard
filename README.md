# TF3 Dashboard — Second Screen Dashboard for Transport Fever 3

Turn a second monitor into a live control room for your Transport Fever 3 company: finances, every line and
vehicle, stations, towns, industries, depots and alerts, with the game's own icons and history charts.
Optionally, manage the game from the dashboard (speed, camera, vehicles, stop configuration, terminals) while
the game stays full screen.

Everything runs locally on your PC. Nothing leaves your computer. No account, no installation, no admin rights.

**Get it:** mod [on mod.io](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard) · companion program on the [Releases](https://github.com/M1r077/tf3-dashboard/releases/latest) page.

## How it works

Two halves:

| Part | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Mod `Second Screen Dashboard`** | [mod.io](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard) (in-game Mod Hub) or `mod/` in this repo | A Lua game script that writes a snapshot of the game state to `<userdata>/dashboard_export/live.lua` every few seconds, and (if you enable it) executes commands written to `cmd.lua`. Uses only the official TF3 scripting API. Never modifies the savegame. |
| **Companion program (this repo)** | Your PC, Windows | `collector.py` watches `live.lua` / `slow_*.lua` and stores the history in a local SQLite database; `server.py` serves the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` in your browser. Python 3.12 standard library only — the release zip ships a bundled Python, nothing to install. |

The mod alone does nothing visible; the companion alone has nothing to show. mod.io cannot distribute programs,
which is why the companion lives here.

## Install (3 steps)

1. **Mod** — in the game, open the Mod Hub, search *Second Screen Dashboard* ([mod.io page](https://mod.io/g/transportfever3/m/second-screen-dashboard)), subscribe, then enable it in your
   savegame's mod list (like any script mod — **subscribing is not enough, the mod must be ticked in the savegame**).
   Or copy `mod/tf3_dashboard_export` to `<userdata>\mods\` (see [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md)).
2. **Companion** — download `TF3-Dashboard-<version>.zip` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/M1r077/tf3-dashboard/releases) page, unzip anywhere **except a cloud-synced folder**
   (OneDrive Desktop/Documents, Dropbox...): the history is a SQLite database and sync clients lock or duplicate it.
   `C:\TF3-Dashboard` or `D:\Games\TF3 Dashboard` are fine. Mod rev 6+ needs companion 0.2.0+.
3. **Run** — start the game with the mod enabled, then double-click `run_dashboard.cmd`. A window with two panes
   opens (collector | server) and your browser shows the dashboard. Put the browser on your second monitor,
   press `F11`. Close the window to stop everything.

Steam, Epic and GOG are supported; the game's userdata folder is detected automatically
(`<Steam>\userdata\<id>\3493540\local` or `%APPDATA%\Transport Fever 3`).

## Install on Linux

Works with the native Linux build and with the Windows build run through Wine / Proton — Heroic (native or
Flatpak), Steam (native build or Proton), Lutris, Bottles, plain Wine. Any distribution with Python 3.10+
(Arch/CachyOS: `python`, Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora: `python3`, usually preinstalled). No bundled Python.

1. **Mod** — as on Windows: subscribe in the in-game Mod Hub and **enable it in the savegame's mod list**.
2. **Companion** — download `TF3-Dashboard-<version>-linux.tar.gz` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/M1r077/tf3-dashboard/releases) page (or clone this repository) and unpack it outside
   a synced folder: `tar -xzf TF3-Dashboard-<version>-linux.tar.gz -C ~` -> `~/TF3-Dashboard`.
3. **Run** — start the game with the mod enabled, then `~/TF3-Dashboard/run_dashboard.sh` in a terminal. Collector
   and server run in that terminal (lines prefixed `[collector]` / `[server]`), it prints the URL and your browser
   shows the dashboard. Ctrl+C or closing the terminal stops everything. `run_dashboard.sh --install-desktop` adds a
   *TF3 Dashboard* entry to the application menu.

The userdata folder is found inside the Wine prefix (`…/drive_c/users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/Transport Fever 3`,
prefixes taken from Heroic's game settings, Steam's `compatdata/3493540`, Lutris, Bottles, `$WINEPREFIX`), in the
Steam userdata folder, or in `~/.local/share/Transport Fever 3` for the native build. The game's icons are read from
the installation Heroic or Steam reports. `python3 collector/tf3paths.py` prints everything that was found.

### Nothing shows up?

While the database is empty the dashboard displays a **checklist** that tells which link of the chain is missing:
game folder found → `live.lua` written by the mod → snapshots stored by the collector. The usual causes:

- the mod is subscribed but **not enabled in the savegame** (Mods menu of the savegame): no `live.lua`;
- the game is in the main menu: the mod only exports while a map is loaded;
- the `dashboard_export` folder does not exist: on some installations the game does not create it and its log
  (`crash_dump\stdout.txt`) repeats `saveUserdata failed: The directory you trying to access is not available`.
  The companion creates the folder when it starts (0.2.2+); with an older companion, create it by hand next to
  `save\` and reload the savegame;
- the game writes to another userdata folder than the one the companion watches (another Steam account, moved
  profile): the checklist reads the game's own log (`crash_dump\stdout.txt`) and shows the folder it uses (0.2.3+);
- the companion runs from OneDrive/Dropbox: see Install, move it;
- the game is installed in an unusual place: create `config.json` (see Configuration).

The "TF3 Dashboard Collector" pane says the same thing in text, colour-coded: green = fine, yellow = waiting or
warning, red = something to fix. Once snapshots flow it prints one summary line per minute (errors are always
shown). When reporting a problem, copy the checklist or that pane, and the lines
containing `dashboard_export` from `stdout.txt`.

Running from source instead of the release zip: you need Python 3.10+ on the PATH (`winget install Python.Python.3.12`).
No pip, no venv, no packages.

### Remote control (optional)

In the game: Mods ▸ Second Screen Dashboard ▸ **Permit game control = On** (off by default). The dashboard
then shows the game controls (pause / speed, camera and saved camera views, vehicle actions, stop and terminal
editor on each line).
Every command does exactly what the matching click in the game does; nothing is ever bought, sold or demolished,
and no route is changed. The channel is a local file (`cmd.lua`) read by the mod four times a second.

## What you see

- **Operations** — fleet in service, load factor and average speed over time, per-carrier summary, stuck or idle
  vehicles, wear (service first), most unhappy and busiest lines, alerts with jump-to-entity.
- **Vehicles** — every vehicle with model icon, line, state, load, speed, condition, history on click. Filter by type.
- **Lines** — load, headway, waiting passengers/cargo, history, and the **stop editor**: load mode, min/max waiting
  time, cargo filter (game icons), preferred and alternative terminals, whole-line actions.
- **Map** — lines, vehicles, stations, industries, towns, alerts; click = camera on the object. **Camera views**
  (mod revision 7): save the game camera under a name and recall it with one click or Shift+1..9. Views are kept
  per savegame in `db\camera_views.json`.
- **Towns**, **Industries**, **Stations & depots**, **Finances**.
- Languages: English, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese — follows the game language automatically.

## Configuration

Nothing to configure in the normal case: the game's userdata folder (Steam: registry + `userdata`; Epic/GOG:
`%APPDATA%\Transport Fever 3`) and the game installation (Steam libraries, Epic manifests, GOG registry — used
only to extract the icons) are detected automatically. For unusual setups, copy `config.example.json` to
`config.json` and keep the keys you need:

```json
{ "export_dir": "C:\\Users\\<you>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Transport Fever 3\\dashboard_export", "game_dir": "C:\\...\\Transport Fever 3", "port": 8765 }
```

Steam: `"export_dir": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\<id>\\3493540\\local\\dashboard_export"`.
Linux paths are written as they are: `"export_dir": "/home/<you>/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/default/Transport Fever 3/drive_c/users/<you>/AppData/Roaming/Transport Fever 3/dashboard_export"`.
`python collector\tf3paths.py` prints what is detected.

Mod settings (in-game): fast interval (time, finances, alerts, vehicles — default 2 s), slow interval (lines,
stations, towns, industries — default 30 s), export vehicles on/off, accept commands on/off, debug log.

## Performance and privacy

- Each snapshot is computed by the game's script thread and costs it some milliseconds (about 10-20 ms on a fast PC
  with a medium network, more on a slow PC or a big network). **If the game stutters at a regular rhythm after
  enabling the mod**, open the mod settings in the savegame and raise the fast interval (5 or 10 s), the slow interval
  (60 or 120 s); on very large networks disable the vehicle export. The defaults (2 s / 30 s) target a reasonably
  recent PC.
- The database keeps per-snapshot detail for 2 hours and per-minute aggregates for 14 days (configurable, see
  `collector.py --help`). Only the most recent savegame is kept.
- The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only. Commands are refused from any other address.
- The game icons are extracted from **your** game installation at first start (`dashboard/extract_icons.py`); they
  are not redistributed.

## Repository layout

```
launch.py       Linux launcher (run_dashboard.sh): starts collector + server, restarts them, opens the browser

```

## Building a release

`build_release.cmd` downloads the official Python embeddable package, assembles `release/TF3-Dashboard-<version>.zip`
(companion + Python, ~15 MB) and `release/tf3_dashboard_export-rev<N>.zip` (the mod for manual installation).
`python3 tools/build_release.py` (any OS) assembles `release/TF3-Dashboard-<version>-linux.tar.gz`: the same
companion without Python, `.sh` launchers with LF line endings and the executable bit.

Two independent version numbers:

- **companion**: `VERSION` in `dashboard/server.py` (shown next to the title in the dashboard). Semver-ish: patch
  (`0.1.x`) for fixes and small adjustments, minor (`0.x.0`) for new features, a new database schema or a dependency
  on a newer mod revision. Every version is a git tag `v<version>` and a GitHub release with its zip, never rebuilt
  afterwards.
- **mod**: `revision` in `mod/tf3_dashboard_export/mod.json`, bumped at each mod.io update only. The
  `tf3_dashboard_export-rev<N>.zip` is attached to a release only when the revision changed.
